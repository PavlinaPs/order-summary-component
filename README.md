- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned more about border radius. I new it is a shorthand but when I looked it up on MDN (link below), I was suprised how many shapes I can create with it. For exapmple: 

```css
.div1 {
  border-radius: 10px 100px / 120px;
}
```
or
```css
.div2 {
  border-radius: 50% 20% / 10% 40%;
}
```

I also tried both ways to add the illustration - as an \<img> or a background-image in css. I decided for \<img> because the illustration as a background-image had a blue line on the bottom and I have not figured out where it came from.

### Continued development

I would like find a better way how to match gaps between components better and also look thoroughly on accessibility of this component.

### Useful resources

- MDN on [border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius)
